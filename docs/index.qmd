# Intro

## Background

### East Timor

### Ermera

Ermera is an administrative district located in the western part of the centre of the island of Timor, approximately 50 kilometres west of the capital city of Dili, in a mountainous terrain with a number of valleys and mountain ranges, one of the main highlands of Timor-Leste. These mountains provide a diverse microclimate that is ideal for agriculture, and the higher altitude provides ideal temperature and humidity conditions for slow coffee fruit ripening, which is very beneficial for enhancing the flavour of the coffee beans. Coffee farming is one of the main economic activities in the Ermera region, with the majority of the population relying directly or indirectly on coffee farming for their livelihoods, and its contribution to the local and national economy is significant, bringing valuable foreign exchange earnings and a large number of employment opportunities to the country, as well as enhancing Timor-Leste's international reputation for coffee.

## Literature review

Coffee plantations benefit from geographical and climatic conditions that are compatible with their unique growing needs. Coffee cultivation is very sensitive to climate, especially variables such as temperature and precipitation (Bilen et al., 2023), and changes in these variables can significantly affect coffee quality and yield (Rahn et al., 2018). Ideal coffee-growing areas usually have specific elevation ranges and soil types to optimise coffee plant health and productivity (González-Orozco et al., 2024). Adaptations such as shade management are essential to mitigate the adverse effects of temperature on coffee (Rahn et al., 2018). Not only does this practice contribute to temperature regulation, but it also has a positive impact on the microclimate (Davis et al., 2012). For example, Arabica coffee prefers higher altitudes where temperatures are cooler, while Robusta coffee is grown at lower altitudes (González-Orozco et al., 2024).

Research predicts that there will be fewer areas suitable for growing coffee due to climate change, which is expected to have a significant impact on yields if adaptation measures are not taken (Camargo, 2010; Bunn et al., 2015). The development of drought and temperature tolerant coffee varieties is also seen as a key adaptation strategy to cope with the negative impacts of global warming and climate change (Camargo, 2010). Geographic and altitudinal changes in coffee-growing areas are necessary to cope with climate change, and suitable coffee-growing areas may increase at higher altitudes (Camargo, 2010). Advanced agricultural technologies such as precision agriculture facilitated by artificial intelligence and remote sensing can optimise inputs such as water and pesticides to improve yields and sustainability (Oliveira et al., 2021).
